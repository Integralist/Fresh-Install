" Notes...
"
" :map     j gg (j will be mapped to gg)
" :map     Q j  (Q will also be mapped to gg, because j will be expanded -> recursive mapping)
" :noremap W j  (W will be mapped to j not to gg, because j will not be expanded -> non recursive)
"
" These mappings work in all modes. To have mappings work in only specific
" modes then denote the mapping with the mode character.
"
" e.g.
" to map something in just NORMAL mode use :nmap or :nnoremap
" to map something in just VISUAL mode use :vmap or :vnoremap

" Clear search buffer
:nnoremap § :nohlsearch<cr>

" Command to use sudo when needed
cmap w!! %!sudo tee > /dev/null %

" No longer needs ctrl+w + direction
nnoremap <C-J> <C-W><C-J>
nnoremap <C-K> <C-W><C-K>
nnoremap <C-L> <C-W><C-L>
nnoremap <C-H> <C-W><C-H>

" Buffers
map <leader>yt :ls<cr>

" Buffers (runs the delete buffer command on all open buffers)
map <leader>yd :bufdo bd<cr>

" Make handling vertical/linear Vim windows easier
map <leader>w- <C-W>- " decrement height
map <leader>w+ <C-W>+ " increment height
map <leader>w] <C-W>_ " maximise height
" map <leader>w\ <C-W>| " maximise width DOESN'T WORK?
map <leader>w[ <C-W>= " equalise all windows

" Handling horizontal Vim windows doesn't appear to be possible.
" Attempting to map <C-W> < and > didn't work
" Same with mapping <C-W>|

" Make splitting Vim windows easier
map <leader>; <C-W>s
map <leader>` <C-W>v
