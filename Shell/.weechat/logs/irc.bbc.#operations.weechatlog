2013-12-05 09:55:09	pkent	morning, does anyone know why https://jira.dev.bbc.co.uk/browse/OPS-103497 - Retrospective CWWTF traffic event - lists Domesday as "Services affected" and no other services? I would have thought that this type of event wouldn't just affect this one PAL app

2013-12-05 09:56:16	 *	pkent had a look at the zenoss graphs for Electron (where a lot of Domesday data is) and saw nothing odd at that time (there was an unusual drop in traffic about 7:15GMT today, but presumably unrelated
2013-12-05 09:56:28	marek	Hey 247, could someone confirm if you got any weird tone when you called me at 07:22 ? I was in transit/cycling to work but I've just checked and the only one I have is from 07:43 o_O
