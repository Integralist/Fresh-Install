2013-12-05 09:56:50	matatat	anyone use phpstorm? just noticed it has support Vagrant http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/
2013-12-05 09:59:20	oliver	matatat: I've used it in the past - I consider it to be the best PHP IDE, fwiw...  To be honest though I'd rather have an IDEA IntelliJ Ultimate and use the plugins library that essentially makes it PHPStorm + RubyMine + PyCharm AND a Java / Scala / Groovy & Clojure IDE ;-)

2013-12-05 10:48:06	Tom_Maslen__London	you can switch flagpoles on and off in the sandbox.  is that what you need info on?
2013-12-05 10:48:06	BrettScott	oliver - you can do this on your sandbox by flicking the flagpoles
2013-12-05 10:48:11	BrettScott	snap

2013-12-05 10:49:41	BrettScott	There are a number of flagpoles for the different parts of IGOR.  You'll probably want:
2013-12-05 10:49:48	BrettScott	flagctl --setvalue worldwide/igor-news-isuk-logic --input ON
2013-12-05 10:49:50	oliver	Tom_Maslen__London: awesome - do you know the flagpole in question's designation, so that I can run the command(s)

2013-12-05 10:50:04	Tom_Maslen__London	BrettScott is saying that I think

2013-12-05 10:50:31	BrettScott	If you want the redirection (which I'm not certain you will on your Sandbox):

2013-12-05 18:07:24	Leo	ok, i'll take a look
2013-12-05 18:07:28	Integralist	Leo: two were because we moved from id's to class names, but there were a couple other failures (waiting for tests to finish)

2013-12-06 09:47:57	Andrew_Hutson	which is similar
2013-12-06 09:48:02	Andrew_Hutson	couldn't find one for x-requested-with though
2013-12-06 09:48:17	sthulb	It's probably 1939
2013-12-06 09:49:02	Andrew_Hutson	has 1939 removed requested-with as well (once it gets deployed)?

2013-12-06 09:50:04	sthulb	1939 should be been deployed already, if it isn't deployed, we've failed... :(
2013-12-06 09:50:25	Andrew_Hutson	x-transclude is definitely not there on the hits i'm seeing
2013-12-06 09:50:33	Andrew_Hutson	but x-requested-with is in its place :(
2013-12-06 09:50:44	sthulb	Then we should probably remove it :)

2013-12-06 10:09:25	Integralist	Dave: I'm getting a failing cuke and I'm not sure how to resolve it as it's specific to mobile?
2013-12-06 10:09:28	Integralist	Dave: features/media_asset_page.feature:146
2013-12-06 10:10:01	Integralist	Dave: when I @debug to open up in the browser the player can playback Audio and so the message the scenario is expecting to see doesn't appear
2013-12-06 10:11:03	sthulb	busy last night: http://i.imgur.com/vWq7MSB.png
2013-12-06 10:11:04	Dave	yeh, Federico and I talked about that, it is because SMP is there now, so it expects the SMP error message
2013-12-06 10:11:16	Dave	It only applies to WS sites
2013-12-06 10:11:50	Dave	as the audio player for WS is using RMP
2013-12-06 10:12:45	Integralist	Federico: Dave so I guess I'll need to change the test to only apply to WS then (not sure how best to do that so if in the mean time any one has any suggestions then let me know otherwise I'll look into it now)
2013-12-06 10:14:43	Dave	if WS are moving to SMP over xmas, we should just WIP it and manually check it

2013-12-06 10:16:45	Integralist	Dave: Federico I'll do that! Much easier/quicker to deal with
2013-12-06 10:17:21	Dave	or you could put the new error message from SMP in, but that doesnt prove the test works, only that flash isnt install in phantom
2013-12-06 10:18:02	Integralist	Dave: I'll WIP it and put a note in the feature file about it
2013-12-06 10:18:16	Dave	this is the dissadvantage of news and ws not using the same player, pradeep__kumar, when test is built, if you could find some audio pages on ws sites and check you get error messages on andoird devices
