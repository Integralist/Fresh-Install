2013-12-05 09:56:50	matatat	anyone use phpstorm? just noticed it has support Vagrant http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/
2013-12-05 09:59:20	oliver	matatat: I've used it in the past - I consider it to be the best PHP IDE, fwiw...  To be honest though I'd rather have an IDEA IntelliJ Ultimate and use the plugins library that essentially makes it PHPStorm + RubyMine + PyCharm AND a Java / Scala / Groovy & Clojure IDE ;-)
2013-12-05 10:00:30	StevenJack	matatat: what exactly does it do with vagrant...
